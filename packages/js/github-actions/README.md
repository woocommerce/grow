## Development

### Directory structure of source code

```
/packages/js/github-actions/  # The root of this package
â”œâ”€â”€ actions/                  # All actions to be exposed in the release build
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ prepare-node/         # Composite action
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md         # How to use this action
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ update-version-tags/  # JavaScript action
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ src/              # Script sources
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ parse-version.js
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repo-tool.js
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                    # Sources of the shared files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ do-something.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json              # The required dependent packages of the scripts, tests, build, and etc
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # The overall info about this Github actions package
```

- The `src` directories will be skipped in the release build.
- When adding a new script that needs to be built, add its build script to package.json and make sure it will be called in `npm run build`.

### Directory structure of release build

```
/                               # Entry points for the caller repositories
â”œâ”€â”€ prepare-node/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ update-version-tags/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ update-version-tags.js  # Built file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md                   # Document prompts viewers to find the correct source code
```

The release build will be committed to a standalone point in the git tree via the release workflow, to make these custom GitHub actions have better paths and can be fetched faster.

## Release

### Official release

1. :technologist: Create the specific branch `release/actions` onto the target revision on `trunk` branch.
1. :octocat: When the branch `release/actions` is created, will continue to commit the release content to `release/actions` branch.
   - Workflow [GitHub Actions - Prepare New Release](https://github.com/woocommerce/grow/actions/workflows/github-actions-prepare-release.yml)
   - Prepend changelog to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
   - Update versions to [package.json](package.json) and [package-lock.json](package-lock.json).
   - Creates a release PR from `release/actions` branch with `trunk` as the base branch.
1. :technologist: Check if the new changelog content and updated version are correct.
   - For a patch version like fixing bugs, increases the Z number. For example, `actions-v1.4.8`.
   - For a minor version like adding new features, increases the Y number and reset the Z to 0. For example, `actions-v1.5.0`.
   - For a major version like having incompatible changes, increases the X number and reset the Y and Z to 0. For example, `actions-v2.0.0`.
   - If something needs to be revised, append the changes in the release PR.
1. :technologist: If it's all good, approve the release PR to proceed with the next workflow.
1. :octocat: Once the release PR is approved, a workflow will create a new release with a new version tag.
   - Workflow [GitHub Actions - Create Release](https://github.com/woocommerce/grow/actions/workflows/github-actions-create-release.yml)
1. :octocat: After publishing the new release, a workflow will continue to create and commit the release build. And then update the references of the corresponding major and minor version tags onto the new release.
   - Workflow [GitHub Actions - Release](https://github.com/woocommerce/grow/actions/workflows/github-actions-release.yml)
   - When the new release version is `actions-v1.4.8`, it should update the references of `actions-v1` and `actions-v1.4` onto `actions-v1.4.8`.
   - When the new release version is `actions-v1.5.0`, it should update the reference of `actions-v1` and create `actions-v1.5` tag onto `actions-v1.5.0`.
   - When the new release version is `actions-v2.0.0`, it should create `actions-v2` and `actions-v2.0` tags onto `actions-v2.0.0`.
1. :technologist: Check if both release workflows are run successfully.
1. :technologist: Merge the release PR.

### Testing release

1. Create a new release with a **prerelease version tag**. For example `actions-vX.Y.Z-pre`.
1. Check if the ["GitHub Actions - Release" workflow](https://github.com/woocommerce/grow/actions/workflows/github-actions-release.yml) is run successfully.
1. Delete the testing releases and tags once they are no longer in use.
